# Text Emotional Classification - LLM

## Project Title
Text Emotional Classification - LLM

## Business Problem
Candidates often lose job opportunities due to poor English language skills and inadequate emotional expression during interviews and communication.

## Business Objectives
- Analyze emotions conveyed in text.
- Assess grammar and usage of filler words.
- Differentiate between formal and informal language.

## Business Constraints
- Maximize manual effort in the analysis process.

## Success Criteria
### Business Success Criteria
- Achieve a 20% increase in job placements.

### Machine Learning Criteria
- Attain at least 90% model accuracy.

### Economic Success Criteria
- Boost product sales by 20%.

## Emotions Analyzed
The project focuses on the following emotions:
- Disheartening
- Worried
- Curious
- Surprised
- Formal
- Assertive
- Confident
- Appreciative
- Concerned
- Informal
- Regretful
- Encouraging
- Egocentric
- Joyful
- Optimistic
- Excited

## Project Summary
The **Text Emotion Classification - LLM** project involved analyzing emotions, grammar, filler words, and formality using datasets from Kaggle and GitHub. The key steps taken include:

- Preprocessing data using regular expressions (regex) and converting text to lowercase.
- Tokenizing the data for custom models.
- Training models using BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2 for classification of 16 emotions.
- Utilizing advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Gemini, Palm, and LLaMA for enhanced performance.
- Evaluating the models using various metrics including accuracy, precision, ROC curves, and BLEU scores.
- Deploying the final model using Streamlit for user interaction and accessibility.
